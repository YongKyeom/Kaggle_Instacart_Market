# Kaggle_Instacart_Market

## Description
* This is Kaggle's recommand problem
* However, We have to ranking with recommand item and guess the right item's number
* Exactly, We have to predict shopping basket
* I use classification model to calculate probability of put item on shopping basket

## Script
* I do this process in kaggle's kernal, there is an only 1 script with data load, preprocess, feature engineering, modeling and prediction
* Use LightGBM with h2o(In h2o, if you want to LightGBM, you just adjust options of xgboost)
